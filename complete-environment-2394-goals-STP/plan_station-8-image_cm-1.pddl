Assignment numeric effect ((current-charge drone1) = 0.000) makes effects on 0 be order-dependent
- Duration of (dynamic_charge drone1 s7-tower-launchpad) is not constant-bounded
Non-constant-bounded duration-dependent effect ((current-charge drone1) +=?duration) makes effects on 0 be order-dependent
